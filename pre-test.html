    <title>Interactive Guide to Unconscious Bias in Microfinance</title>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals & Serene Blue -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as a thematic, single-page dashboard with sticky navigation. This structure was chosen over a linear report format to empower users to explore topics non-linearly based on their interests (e.g., a user might jump directly to "Mitigation Strategies"). Key sections are: 1) What is Bias? (Foundational concepts), 2) Types of Bias (Interactive explorer), 3) The Impact (Data visualizations), and 4) Mitigation (Action-oriented steps). This task-oriented flow breaks down complex information into digestible chunks, enhancing user engagement and comprehension. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Intro Stat: Goal=Inform/Engage, Method=Animated Counter (JS), Justification=Grabs attention and illustrates the brain's processing scale.
        - Types of Bias: Goal=Organize/Inform, Method=Interactive HTML/CSS Cards, Interaction=Click to reveal details, Justification=Prevents cognitive overload from a long list and encourages active exploration.
        - Gender Bias in Lending: Goal=Compare, Method=Bar Chart (Chart.js/Canvas), Interaction=Hover tooltips, Justification=Clearly visualizes the disparity in loan amounts vs. profitability, a key finding in the report.
        - Impact on Client Relations: Goal=Inform, Method=Styled HTML/CSS list, Justification=Presents qualitative examples of microaggressions clearly.
        - Mitigation Strategies: Goal=Organize/Inform, Method=Tabbed Layout (HTML/JS), Interaction=Clickable tabs for Individual vs. Organizational, Justification=Separates a large amount of information into actionable categories, making it easier for users to find relevant strategies.

                     <p class="text-center text-stone-600 mb-10">This section introduces the fundamental concept of unconscious bias. It explains the science behind why our brains create mental shortcuts to manage an overwhelming amount of information and why this matters deeply in the context of microfinance, where fairness and equity are paramount to the mission.</p>

                            <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed">Unconscious biases are the mental shortcuts (heuristics) our brains use to handle this information overload. While efficient, they can lead to inaccurate, unfair judgments. In microfinance, the mission is to serve marginalized populations. If staff unknowingly carry biases based on gender, disability, or race, they can unintentionally perpetuate the very inequalities they aim to solve. This can lead to unfair lending decisions, damage client relationships, and ultimately undermine the economic and social goals of the institution.</p>
